## MOLding: Gesture-based Interactive Molecular Dynamics for Protein Structure Manipulation

MOLding is a derivative of Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) software that provides an intuitive user interface for interactive molecular dynamics (IMD) employing hand gestures.

VMD is originally developed by the Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group in the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
