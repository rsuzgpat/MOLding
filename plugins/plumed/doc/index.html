<h2>A general collective variable analysis tool (PLUMED GUI)</h2>
<p>
The PLUMED collective variable analysis tool is a VMD plugin that provides
access to the extensive set of collective variables (CV) defined in the
[22]PLUMED software. It allows you to:
<ul>
<li>analyze the currently loaded trajectory by evaluating and plotting
    arbitrary CVs
<li>use VMD's atom selection keywords to define atom groups and ready-made
    templates for common CVs
<li>export the CV definition file for use in MD simulations
<li>prepare reference files for RMSD, path-variable, native contacts, etc.
<li>analyze DCD files in batches
</ul>

<p>
Please check that you have the latest version installed.

<h3>Usage</h3>
   The usage of the plugin is straightforward.

<p>
<ol>
<li>From VMD's main window, select "Extensions-&gt;Analysis-&gt;Collective
    variable analysis (PLUMED)"
<li>Edit the CV definition file, defining one or more CVs
<li>Enter the number of CVs defined in the corresponding box
<li>Click "Plot". This will open a plot window with the selected CVs.
</ol>

<p>
CV definition files can be opened, edited and saved as usual. Save and
Save as... save the currently open file varbatim, while the Export..
function performs the atom selection replacements (see below), thus
creating a META_INP file that can be used directly in simulations. The
Edit menu provides the usual text-editing options.

<p>
Elements in the [23]Templates menu provides shortcuts for most CVs
supported by PLUMED. Please refer to PLUMED's [24]user's guide for the
full syntax.

<p>
Square brackets can be used to conveniently define atom groups (Ctrl-G).
During evaluation, atom selection keywords in square brackets are replaced
with a list of the corresponding serial numbers for the top molecule.

<p>
When Plot is clicked, the currently loaded trajectory is exported to a
temporary directory (shown in the console), and the driver utility is
invoked. If there are no errors, a plot will show the CVs evaluated on the
frames of the current trajectory.

<h3>Reference structures for RMSD and path variables</h3>

   The File-&gt;Prepare[25] reference structure... dialog can be used to prepare
   pseudo-PDB files that can be used as reference structures for RMSD,
   path-variables, etc. Two VMD atom selections are required to define the
   set of atoms that will be used for alignment (alignment set) and for the
   distance measurement (displacement set), respectively. The currently
   selected frame of the top molecule is used to create a reference file;
   numbering can be altered to conform to another molecule. The file format
   is specified in the 'Path collective variables' section of the PLUMED
   manual. Note: After generating the structures, remember to set the top
   molecule to the one you want to analyze.

<h3>Native contacts</h3>

   The Edit-&gt;Native contacts CV inserts a native-contacts CV. The currently
   selected frame of the top molecule is taken as the native state. Atom
   numbers are adapted to fit the structure indicated in the target molecule
   field. If selection 2 is given, only intermolecular contacts (between
   selection 1 and 2) are counted. Otherwise, contacts internal in selection
   1 are considered. The Distance cutoff selects the radius to consider
   contacts in the native state. If only one selection is given, contacts can
   be filtered with the D resid option (see description in [26]RMSD
   trajectory tool enhanced with native contacts). Group name specifies the
   label for two atom lists (that will be placed at the top of the plumed
   file). Note: After generating the CV lines, remember to set the top
   molecule to the one you want to analyze.

<h3>Batch analysis</h3>

   Once a script is tested, the menu option File-&gt;Batch analysis...  allows you
   to apply it to all of the DCD files in a chosen directory. The files are
   processed according to the current settings, and need to match the top
   molecule. If the Combine option is unselected, a .dcd.colvar file will be
   created along with each .dcd trajectory. If the Combine option is
   selected, the metrics for the various trajectories will be joined in a
   single metric.dat file. Lines of the file contains the file name, followed
   by the usual COLVAR columns (without header). Note: existing .colvar or
   metric.dat files will be overwritten without warning. You can set Number
   of processes to run multiple processes concurrently; it is advantageous to
   spawn between 1 and 2 times the number of CPU cores you have.

<h3>Notes</h3>

   The number of CVs defined has to be entered manually. In case of errors,
   inspect the console; it will provide diagnostics and the location of the
   temporary files. Hills deposition should be disabled. Periodic boundary
   conditions should to be set especially when dealing with non-wrapped
   solvent or with MD engines which "break" molecules by wrapping them. The
   Electrostatic energy and Dipole CVs require charges to be defined in the
   currently loaded molecule, so AMBER or CHARMM topology file have to be
   loaded beforehand. Some options have not been included in the templates.

   Note that PLUMED's 1.2.0 parser for alignment structures is somewhat
   broken; workarounds are used, but feel free to apply the following patch
   to fix it permanently [32]patch-pdbparser.

   The plugin is current for PLUMED version 1.2.0.
