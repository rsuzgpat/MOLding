Description:



Control your computer's VMD session from your Android device!

This app requires you to have VMD 1.9.1, from the Theoretical and
Computational Biophysics Group at the University of Illinois, installed on your
computer.

Note:  This app does NOT give you the ability to run VMD _ON_ your Android
device.  It allows you to remotely control a VMD session running on your desktop
computer.

Once this app is connected to a running VMD session you can use it rotate,
translate, and pinch 'n zoom your system.  It can be used to move through
the frames of a trajectory that you have loaded into VMD and can also act
as a tracker.

Script writers can configure the four user buttons to perform whatever VMD
action they desire.

Visit the website http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/ for more information on
the VMD program and usage of the app.
